### Evalutation : webserv

### Introduction

Please comply with the following rules:

- Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive throughout the  
evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.

- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible  
dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the  
problems that may have been identified.

- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers  
might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its  
functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as  
possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is  
done seriously.

### Guidelines

- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated  
student or group.

- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that  
the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an  
empty folder.

- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you  
evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.

- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used  
to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).

- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have  
to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.

- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning  
program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth.  
In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0,  
or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are  
strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order  
to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.

- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault, no other  
unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected termination of the  
program, else the final grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag.  
You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it  
exists. If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons  
with the evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.

- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on  
the heap must be properly freed before the end of execution.  
You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer,  
such as leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the  
appropriate flag.
